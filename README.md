🌍 World Timezone App

Hi there 👋

This is a small project I built to learn and practice JavaScript + Bootstrap.
It shows the current local time on your system and also lets you check the time in other cities around the world (like New York, London, India, Tokyo, Sydney).

I kept it simple so it runs directly in the browser — no installation needed.

✨ What it does

Shows your local time & date

Lets you pick another timezone and instantly see its current time

Updates every second automatically

Uses a clean Bootstrap UI

📂 Files inside

timezone.html → the webpage

timezone.js → the logic that updates the clocks
